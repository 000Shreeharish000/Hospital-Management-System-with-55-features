# Hospital Management System for SRM UNIVERSITY TRICHY

A comprehensive, modular, cloud-ready Hospital Operating System built during a 50-hour Med-Tech Makeathon, designed to digitize end-to-end hospital operations across clinical, emergency, administrative, compliance, and infrastructure domains.

---

## 📌 Project Context

- **Event:** 50-Hour MedAIThon 
- **Category:** HealthTech / MedTech / Hospital Software Systems
- **Architecture:** Modular, scalable, enterprise-grade
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Status:** ⚠️ Database currently inactive for Privacy and NDA purpose

This project was built to address real hospital pain points, not just CRUD workflows.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern hospitals operate with fragmented, paper-heavy, and siloed systems, leading to:

- Operational delays
- Medical errors
- Compliance risks
- Poor patient experience
- Lack of executive visibility

This system consolidates **55+ hospital workflows** into one unified digital platform.

---

## 🧠 System Vision

- Replace paper-based workflows with secure digital processes
- Enable real-time coordination between departments
- Ensure regulatory compliance (NABH, medico-legal, audit trails)
- Provide data-driven decision making via dashboards & analytics
- Be extensible for AI, NLP, and automation

---

## 🧩 Core Architecture

- **Frontend:** React (Modular UI, role-based access)
- **Backend:** Node.js + REST APIs
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth:** Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Design Philosophy:** Software-only (no mandatory hardware dependency)
